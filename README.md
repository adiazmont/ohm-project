Computer numerical control (CNC) software - Hybrid Java-Matlab integration
Final year project from CETYS University, Mexicali, BC, Mexico (2016).

With the increase of research and development in the robotics field, new trends in the IoT phenomena, and the matureness of the 3d fabrication/printing industry; there has been global interest in elaborating an in home all-in-one product creation lab.

The proposed CNC Resistor Sorter uses the same model of function as a 3D printer with added image processing. It builds a platform that could serve as a pillar in all-in-one product creation lab.
